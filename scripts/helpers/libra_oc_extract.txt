The extract process assumes you have a locally hosted endpoint that can talk to the production instance of SOLR and Fedora. Configured for
localhost:9000. You can create a local tunnel as follows:

# host we are tunneling from
export REMOTE_SERVER=libraprod.lib.virginia.edu

# port or service we are tunneling
export REMOTE_PORT=8983

# where we want the local tunnel to be
export LOCAL_PORT=9000

ssh -v -nNT -L $LOCAL_PORT:localhost:$REMOTE_PORT $REMOTE_SERVER

#
# end of file
#
