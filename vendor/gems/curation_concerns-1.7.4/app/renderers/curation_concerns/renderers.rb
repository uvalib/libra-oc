module CurationConcerns
  # Module that will contain Renderer classes
  # @since 0.14.0
  # Renderers are used to display Ruby objects to users and take arguments from the CurationConcerns::Presenter
  # supplied by the controller.
  # They are typically used to respond to read requests from the controller, and may apply some level of
  # HTML, or may just display human readable values for object attributes.
