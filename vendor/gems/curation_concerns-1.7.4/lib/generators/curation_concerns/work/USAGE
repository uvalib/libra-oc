  This generator creates the necessary files for new work types.

    app/actors/curation_concerns/scholarly_paper_actor.rb
    app/controllers/curation_concerns/scholarly_papers_controller.rb
    app/views/curation_concerns/scholarly_papers/.keep
    config/workflows/scholary_paper_workflow.json
    spec/factories/scholarly_paper_factory.rb
    spec/models/scholarly_paper_spec.rb
    spec/actors/curation_concerns/scholarly_paper_actor_spec.rb
    spec/controllers/curation_concerns/scholarly_papers_controller_spec.rb

  This will also:
